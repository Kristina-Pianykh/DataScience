# DataScience

This repository contains 5 projects for the module _Statistics and Data Science_ at the Humboldt University of Berlin.

#### Note:

To install project dependencies open a folder `Uebungsblatt*` in your editor and run `poetry install` to create a virtual environment.
`poetry shell` activates the newly created venv with all the required dependencies.

### The project overview:

**Uebungsblatt0**:

- exploratory analysis of a small dataset on sunshine hours over time using _pandas_

  **Uebungsblatt1**:

- descriptive statistical analysis of the data on death causes across different age groups and genders over time

* generation of a maltitude of simulated samples from a limited dataset by bootstrapping (a resampling technique with replacement)

**Uebungsblatt2**:

- implementation of exact and approximative permutation tests using only the standard Python library and performing an exact statistical hypothesis test with different hyper-parameters

**Uebungsblatt3**:

- detailed selection and application of an appropriate hypothesis test (Student's t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, etc.) based on provided data and the validity of the tests assumptions

* implementation of a Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis, trained and tested on the IMDb dataset to classify movie reviews as positive or negative

**Uebungsblatt4**:

- examination of a prediction model's performance using evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, etc.)

* implementation of a neural net to classify an image of a hand-written digit to its respective numerical value based on the MNIST-dataset and using only the Python standard library and NumPy

* evaluation of the model's behavior given different hyper-parameters (number of epochs, batch size, learning rate)

**Uebungsblatt5**:

- computation of a closed-form solution of the given linear regression equation

* computation of the zeros of the given functions using a self-implemented Newton's algorithm

* implementation of a k-means clustering algorithm to classify the images of the hand-written digits from the MNIST-dataset

* evaluation and visualization of the clustering model
