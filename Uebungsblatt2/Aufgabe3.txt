Aufgabe 3a)
2)
The difference of 2.6 between the means of the two samples is not significant
as the p-value (p=0.381) is above the set alpha level of 0.05. Hence, the null hypothesis of no difference cannot be rejected.

3)
The output of the t-test for independant samples with the assumption of qual variance in the samples
carried out using scipy.stats.ttest_ind is as follows:
Ttest_indResult(statistic=0.9630818692995163, pvalue=0.3637101975769613)

The results indicate that the difference in the means of the samples is not significant
based on the p-value of roughly 0.364. The null hypothesis of no difference cannot be rejected.


Aufgabe 3b)

2)
The output of the program permutationtest.py for an approximative t-test using the data from
gmbh.txt and konkurrent.txt with 20 000 unqiue permutations is as follows:

Differenz zwischen den Mittelwerten: -1.3763
P-Wert (p=0.0122)

The p-value is below the significance level of 0.05 and thus we can reject the null hypothesis of
no difference between the means.

3)
We now carry out the approximative permutation test from 2) 10 times. The results are below:
1. p=0.0109
2. p=0.0115
3. p=0.0112
4. p=0.0112
5. p=0.011
6. p=0.0111
7. p=0.0109
8. p=0.0109
9. p=0.0112
10. p=0.0097

Each of the tests delivers the p-value below the significance level, meaning the difference between the means
of the given datasets is significant.

5)
The results of the approximative permutation test from 2) for the following number of permutations:
n = 10: p = 0.0
n = 1000: p = 0.007
n = 10000: p = 0.011
n = 100000: p = 0.0115

6)
for 20000 permutations: Ttest_indResult(statistic=2.559682021137714, pvalue=0.011)
The p-value for the t-test with 20000 random permutations permofmed with scipy.stats.ttest_ind
is 0.011 and below the significance level of 0.05. With that, the difference in the means of both products
is significant, and the null hypothesis can be rejected.
